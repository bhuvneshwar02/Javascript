// You are enhancing the library system to manage different types of books. Your task is to create a Book class and a Magazine class that inherits from Book.

// The Book class should have the following properties:

// title (string) - The title of the book.
// author (string) - The author of the book.
// year (number) - The year the book was published.
// The Book class should have the following method:

// getSummary() - This method should return a string summarizing the book details in the format: "Title by Author, published in Year."
// The Magazine class should inherit from the Book class and add the following property:

// month (string) - The month the magazine was published.
// The Magazine class should override the getSummary() method to include the month in the summary. The method should return a string in the format: "Title by Author, published in Month Year."

// Create both classes and demonstrate how to create instances of both classes and call the getSummary() method.

class Book {
    constructor (title,author,year) {
        this.title=title;
        this.author=author;
        this.year= year;
    }
    getSummary() {
        return `${this.title} by ${this.author}, published in ${this.year}.`;
    }
}

class Magazine extends Book{
    constructor(title,author,year,month) {
        super(title,author,year);
        this.month=month;
    }
    getSummary(){
        return `${this.title} by ${this.author}, published in ${this.month} ${this.year}.`;
    }
}
const myBook =  new Book('The Great Gatsby','F. Scott Fitzgerald',1925);
console.log(myBook.getSummary());

const myMagazine= new Magazine('National Geographic', 'Various Authors', 2021,'June');
console.log(myMagazine.getSummary());
